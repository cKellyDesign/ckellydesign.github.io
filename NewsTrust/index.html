  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p>An informed public is essential to the continued functioning of a healthy democracy. There are many channels contributing to the information ecosystem in which we live today; these platforms vary in medium, levels of engagement, levels of use, and levels in trust among the general population.</p>

  <p>Understanding how and why we inform ourselves via the media these channels produce is of critical importance in the matter of information quality and validity, especially in a culture of increasing dis/misinformation, “fake news”, and “alternative facts”. This report seeks to shed light on the “how” through data exploration and analysis.</p>

  <h2 id="data">Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    This is a dataset populated by an online survey asking which platforms participants have used to consume news information how much they trust various platforms in terms of news information. The survey was written about by BuzzFeed and the the raw dataset can be accessed in their <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-01-media-platform-and-news-trust-survey">GitHub repository</a>. BuzzFeed has applied to their <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-01-media-platform-and-news-trust-survey/blob/master/data/ipsos-crosstabs.xlsx">cross tabulations</a> additional analytical participant weights including income, gender, race, and geographic location. For the sake of this assignment I have foregone this extra analysis and will be using the raw responses from only a few columns (an index or which is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jSxuUySZ5zYviHSqXYwz0eogsS76QPQXT8lWaqnIis/edit?usp=sharing">available here</a>).

  <div class="one-half column alpha">
    <h3>Platform Usage</h3>
    <p>Participants responded yes or no for “Social Media (generally)” and for each platform considered in the study. In my analysis this 0 - 1 range was normalized by averaging this response across subdividing metrics (eg - 33% of 19 year old males reported using Facebook as a news source).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="one-half column">

    <h3>Platform Trust</h3>
    <p>For each platform, participants responded on a likert scale of 1 - 5 (or 6 for “Don’t know” which has been excluded from this report) producing ordinal data representing “All the time” to “Almost Never”. These values are normalized by averaging responses and reversing the ordinal scale for the sake of visual clarity.</p>

  <h2 id="insights">Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
  <p>Initially I began my exploration by comparing trust and usage metrics separately across the various platforms in 12 dimensional scatterplot matrices. At this bird's eye view I could add additional filters and other metrics to see how these various attributes played out over the entire range of sources. Interesting pattern emerged such as age seriation and gender seriation. These patterns quickly became much more interesting when comparing trust to use as in Figure 1.</p>
  
  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Social Media (generally) Use and Trust by Age and Gender</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/00_Aa_SM_TrustbyUse_by_AgeGender__.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 1. While viewing the univariate distribution (left) of Social Media Use reveals an age gradation, comparing Social Media Use to Trust shows a much richer distribution, illuminating age seriation in both dimensions and limits occlusion. 
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>While extrapolating this approach across all news source platforms creates an extremely dense and interesting set of visualizations it is rather unwieldy and is very susceptible to occlusion, as seen in Figure 2.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Platform Use by Platform Trust</h1>

    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 2. Seven dimensional bird’s eye view of platform use by trust.
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>Up until this point I had been mapping color values to participant ages at the expense of encoding gender with a less effective shape. Desiring to better view any discrepancies between platform use, platform trust, and age I turned to a line chart representation. Figures 3 and 4 show platform use across age with platform trust being doubly encoded as line width and color saturation.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Social Media (generally) Use by Age and Trust</h1>

    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 3. Viewing social media (generally) as a news source across age with trust being encoded as linewidth and saturation to illustrate trust across age.
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>Extrapolating this approach across select platforms begins to reveal patterns of use and trust.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Platform Use by Age and Trust</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/04.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 4. Viewing platforms across age with trust being encoded as linewidth and saturation to illustrate trust across age.
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>Pivoting from in this visual encoding I sought to more prominently express the metrics of gender and trust and instead encoded platform trust to the Y-axis, platform use to the linewidth, and broke gender into two color encoded lines.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Social Media (generally) vs Printed Newspaper : Trust, Use, Gender, and Age</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/05.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">

    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>In true fashion, as I was considering the layout for figure 7 I attempted to categorize the different platforms for the first time, revolutionizing my mental model of the problem space and showing me that exploration is never over! Figure 6 shows how each platform can be categorized by method of presenting content to the user. While this needs much more research, even a rudimentary evaluation of platform content typology reveals clear differences between platforms.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Platforms by Information Medium</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/06.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 6. Platforms by informational medium.
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>With this in mind I separated my small multiples by this new categorization, grouping multi-methodological “Hybrid” platforms and uni-methodological “Video” platforms and sure enough patterns immerged.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>"Hybrid Platforms" Trust by Age, Gender, and Use</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/07_.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 7. “Hybrid Platforms” offering textual information, rich media content, and links to external sources see a trend of higher trust and use by younger participants. Interestingly, Newspapers’ Websites usage trends towards older participants without losing trust from the younger.
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <p>While the sources in Figure 8 are all video centric they are subdivided between more traditional platforms and social media platforms. This categorization is supported by the striking differences in trends, of particular interest is the gulf seen between younger men and women’s trust in social media video platforms.</p>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>"Video Platforms" Trust by Age, Gender, and Use</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/08_.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 8. “Video Platforms” which primarily offer video content are divided between traditional sources (Cable News and Broadcast News) and social media sources (YouTube and SnapChat). As seen here, traditional sources are more uniformly trusted across age and gender while social media sources show wider ranges of trust and usage across other metrics.
    </aside>
  </figure>

  <figure class="entry">
    <h1>Gulf of Trust between Men and Women on Video Centric Social Media Platforms</h1>
    <img src="./imgs/09.jpg" />
    <aside class="caption">
    Figure 9. An interesting pattern reveals itself when looking at social media trust between men and women, especially in video centric platforms. Here we see 18-19 year old women reporting more trust in YouTube and SnapChat than men, then inverting after the age of 20 before normalizing at around 45 years of age.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    After analysing this dataset at length there are few conclusions that can be drawn and more questions have been opened up for further exploration in future work. It would seem men between the ages of around 24 to 34 are very trusting of the news information from social media and traditional sources. As one may have expected, patterns in platform use and trust are prominently polarized by age, with older participants trending towards traditional sources and younger participants towards social media sources. Finally, I was quite surprised to see several platforms had strong trust among participants, despite not being identified as a source of news by the individuals.</p>

    <p>I believe the next step is to begin understanding the reasons for some of these phenomenon, how platform categorization effect trust and use, and especially how these “hybrid” platforms play a part in the greater information ecosystem.
